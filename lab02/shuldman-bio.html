        <h1>Avery's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Avery Shuldman and I am a <strong>television, radio, and film</strong>
            major at Syracuse University interested in media production, video 
            editing, and social media.

            This summer, I worked at a startup company called Modern Picnic where I 
            created video assets for our social media channels. I posted a video on 
            our tik tok account that received 1.5 million views and increased our 
            sales by 745% in 24 hours.
