        Hi! My name is Avery Shuldman and I am a television, radio, and film major at Syracuse University interested in media production, video editing, and social media. This summer, I worked at a startup company called Modern Picnic where I created video assets for our social media channels. I posted a video on our tik tok account that received 1.5 million views and increased our sales by 745% in 24 hours. I am skilled in adobe premiere pro, photoshop, and project management. Outside of work, I love to watch TV and movies, I like to paint, and I like to play pickleball.
